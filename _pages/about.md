	{GPA:3.42; Research Interests: Sensor attacks pose a serious threat to autonomous driving perception systems. Multi-sensor fusion techniques and anomaly detection algorithms are used to monitor the inconsistency of sensor data to achieve attack detection and localization. Vehicle dynamics are modeled and machine learning algorithms are combined to achieve data recovery. Finally, a real-time, high-precision attack detection and defense method for perception systems is proposed.
